Check out the draft of my quarantine Mars Mapping Project!

My science research has me using Google Scholar to search for the latest and greatest Mars articles, and Google Earth (Mars layer) to search the planet for the location of images and interesting features.

I wanted something to bring together the best of both worlds. A map of Mars with the locations of published scientific articles. After learning a bit of Python, Javascript, Databases, and HTML I put together the site linked below.

The main challenge is that there is no easily accessible or standard formation for locations in a paper. For now, we need to read through and extract the locations, coordinates, and context for the study areas by hand. So far I have done this for my Mars papers and a few other titles and am adding a few more every day. Let me know if you have any comments, ideas, or would like to add your papers to the map!
